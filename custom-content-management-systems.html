              A content management system (CMS) is software that enables a
              website administrator to easily create, manage, and publish text,
              images, and multimedia on their website. Torx’s custom content
              management systems require little or no technical knowledge to
              operate. Within a matter of minutes, almost anyone can learn how
              to update their website’s content without any understanding of
              HTML or other programming languages.

            <h2>But What About WordPress?</h2>
            <p>
              WordPress is often a terrific solution for many different types of
              websites. It has come a long, long way since the very first
              version was released over a decade ago, and new features,
              functionality, and plugins are constantly being created to make
              each new version better than the last. But for some incredibly
              complex websites, WordPress is actually not the best tool for the
              job. WordPress is a very flexible content management system, but
              some websites have such very unique business requirements and
              functionality, that trying to force those requirements and
              functionality into WordPress is like trying to hammer a nail with
              a screwdriver. Sure, it might be possible to “hack” a very
              complicated and intricate website into WordPress, but it’s
              sometimes not the most efficient or cost-effective approach.

              <h2>Creating An <strong>À La Carte </strong> Solution</h2>
              <p>
                In addition to WordPress, there are many other off-the-shelf
                content management products currently available, but that type
                of software often has many bloated features that go unused. They
                sometimes have a steep learning curve, which results in a loss
                of time and money. With a custom content management solution,
                Torx offers an à la carte approach – only select the features
                that you need. We will analyze your website’s needs to create a
                unique CMS specifically tailored for your business objectives. A
                scaled-down solution makes your custom CMS easy to learn and
                easy to manage, especially when dealing with larger websites
                that have unique and sometimes complicated business
                requirements. Whether a custom CMS is the right solution, or
                whether WordPress is the right solution, we’ll help you select
                the right tool for the job.

            Custom content management systems are built to exact specifications,

            Unlike off-the-shelf CMSs, all of which have their limitations,

            There is far less mystery surrounding the underlying programming of
            the custom CMS. Because a custom CMS begins as a “blank slate”, its
            programmers become extremely familiar with every aspect of it.

            There is less of a security risk. Because of the widespread use of
            WordPress, arguably the most popular CMS, it has become the target
            of hackers.

            Because a custom content management system has no need for plugins,
