            </h2>
            <p>
              While some websites are very simple – having just enough
              information to enable visitors to learn more and make contact –
              other websites may have a need for more advanced website
              development. Dynamic content and interactive elements within a
              website often require the use of a database. Databases store
              various pieces of information that are presented to website
              visitors based on what actions they take while browsing the site.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, one of the most common uses of a database is to store
              “Upcoming Events” or “News” for your customers to view. This
              information is saved in a database so that it can be easily
              updated – either by a web developer, or even by a non-technical
              individual via an easy-to-use content management system (CMS).

                The sky is the limit when designing and building advanced
                websites and databases. Here are just a few (of the many, many)
                examples of what is possible:

                to determine what programming is required for business
                objectives, as well as the most time and cost-effective methods
                for implementing these dynamic items.

            For our client, Blue Ocean Brain, we designed and developed a
            completely customized online casual gaming experience. Every part of
            the website – from user accounts, to tracking game scores, to
            earning achievements, to competing with other users – was
            constructed without having to rely on an off-the-shelf content
            management system. This project’s requirements were so unique, that
            using a pre-made CMS would have been the wrong tool for the job.

            Video content has become increasingly popular over the past several
            years. A perfect example of this is Recruiting Sports Network. For
            this custom web app, we developed a system that enables high school
            athletes to upload highlight videos, which are then viewed and
            downloaded by college coaches and recruiters. All uploaded videos
            are automatically converted to web-friendly formats, and the custom
            search functionality enables students and coaches to quickly connect
            with each other.

            The Ray A. Williams Custom Homes website project had a very unique
            set of requirements, resulting in the creation of a
            highly-customized content management system. We designed and
            developed a very easy-to-use CMS that enables our client to manage
            their collection of home styles. They have the ability to specify
            home features (e.g. number of stories, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.),
            upload photos, upload floor plans, and manage other pieces of web
            content as well.
