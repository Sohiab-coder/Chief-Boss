              WordPress is so
              <strong>easy!</strong>
            </h2>
            <p>
              There are many, many off-the-shelf content management systems to
              choose from these days. It’s possible that you may have already
              heard of some of these: Joomla, Drupal, Magento, ExpressionEngine,
              Squarespace… the list goes on and on. WordPress though, is by far
              and away, the most widely used content management system (CMS). As
              of January 2022, WordPress’s CMS market share is an incredible
              65%.
            </p>
            <p>
              The primary reason that so many website owners have their sites
              built using WordPress, is because it’s is so easy to use. There is
              very little learning curve, and even the most non-technical
              individuals can manage and update their website’s content
              effortlessly. Website administrators do not need to know HTML or
              CSS, let alone nerdy scripting languages such as Javascript or
              PHP. Using WordPress is as easy – if not easier – than using
              Microsoft Word and Excel.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s no secret that here at Torx, we’re big fans of WordPress. It
              makes our clients’ lives easier, and it is also developer-friendly
              as well. WordPress is based on PHP code and a MySQL database, both
              of which are programming languages and technologies that we are
              very, very familiar with. We are incredibly comfortable working
              with WordPress, whether it’s locating and implementing one of its
              many, many plugins, or whether we’re diving deep into WordPress’s
              core codebase to “hack” at something in order to meet a client’s
              unique (and sometimes very complicated) business requirements.

              <h2>Choosing the <strong>right tool </strong> for the job</h2>
              <p>
                It is very important to point out though, that even with all of
                WordPress’s advantages, it is not always the right tool for the
                job. Its vast collection of plugins and the capability to make
                edits and revisions to its core codebase, make it extremely
                flexible. But some much larger websites and web application
                projects are actually a better fit for custom content management
                systems. Before any new project gets under way, we first
                acknowledge the pros and cons of developing in WordPress vs.
                creating a custom CMS. Our recommendation is typically based on
                overall business requirements, as well as what option is the
                most budget-friendly for our clients.
