        <div class="careers-para">
          <p>
            We’re not looking for “rock stars”, “ninjas” or “gurus”. But we ARE
            looking for ambitious and talented individuals who have an interest
            in all things digital marketing. It doesn’t matter if you’re fresh
            out of school or have been around the block a few times. If you are
            a web developer, an account manager, or if you have experience in
            other areas of digital marketing, we’d love to hear from you. Read
            on to learn more about working at Torx.

        <h2>We get it. It's a job.</h2>
        <p>
          One of the questions we ask during interviews is, “Why do you want to
          work at Torx?” We’ve heard a wide variety of answers, but the primary
          reason is that you almost certainly want to get paid. We get it. It’s
          a job. A job is NOT your entire existence though, and while we do work
          hard here, we also understand that there is life outside of Torx. We
          have deadlines to meet and clients to please just like any other
          agency, but we also make every attempt to maintain a casual and
          stress-free work-life balance. Check out some absolutely-not-staged
          photos below, and then scroll a bit further to learn about our
          benefits and perks.

              <p>
                After a short 3-month waiting period, all full-time employees
                are eligible to participate in Torx’s group health insurance
                plan. Torx pays for 50% of the total cost of an enrolled
                employee’s health insurance premium.

                Torx’s Simple IRA retirement benefits begin after a 6-month
                waiting period for new team members. Our Northwestern Mutual
                representative will help employees determine how to best set up
                their contributions, and Torx will match a maximum of 3%.

              <p>
                When the business has a profitable year, so do our team members.
                Every December, we crunch the year’s numbers, and a portion of
                Torx’s profits get shared between everyone. It’s MUCH better
                than a one-year membership to the Jelly of the Month Club!

              <p>
                It should go without saying that team members are compensated
                for the value that they add to the business. Contributions and
                achievements and recognized, and pay raises are determined
                during annual performance reviews.

              <p>
                All new employees immediately receive 10 paid vacation days per
                year. Additional paid vacation days are awarded EVERY year until
                the maximum limit of 20 days/year is reached at the beginning of
                a team member’s 7th year.

              <p>
                Our sick leave policy is quite simple. If you’re sick, don’t
                come into the office! Team members do not have a maximum number
                of sick days per year, and that policy will remain in place as
                long as it doesn’t get abused.

                Torx’s maternity leave policy consists of 2 weeks of paid leave
                + the option of up to 4 additional weeks of unpaid leave. Our
                paternity leave policy consists of 1 week of paid leave + the
                option of up to 4 additional weeks of unpaid leave. An
                employee’s health insurance premium remains uninterrupted during
                the optional period of unpaid leave.
