              Create
              <strong>value</strong> and build <strong>trust</strong>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Content marketing takes many different forms: Blog posts,
              podcasts, videos, SlideShare presentations, infographics, etc. But
              the strategy is simple: Businesses can attract potential
              customers, and retain repeat customers, by creating something
              valuable and sharing it for free. For example, some brands do this
              by writing blog posts or e-books with useful information that
              customers want, while others create interesting videos or
              interactive content to entertain. Smart brands also share great
              content from other brands, because they’re more interested in
              keeping their customers engaged than fruitlessly promoting
              themselves over and over.
            </p>
            <p>
              In each scenario, content marketing helps brands build positive
              connections and trust with their customers, who are generally sick
              of being bombarded with hard-sell tactics. Content marketing
              doesn’t tell customers to buy something – it shows them how they
              would benefit from that purchase and explains why that product or
              service is a good fit for them.

            Simply put, customers hate ads. The difference is in the delivery,
            and the future of advertising lies in ads that don’t overtly appear
            to be selling anything. No one wants to be shown an ad, but they
            might be interested in content that addresses their interests or
            answers their questions. Affiliate marketers on blogs and
            influencers on Instagram are all pushing something, but their
            customers are genuinely interested in what they have to say.

            Customers crave content that entertains, interests or helps them,
            and good content builds faith in your brand. Content marketing
            creates less of a sales funnel and more of a sales ecosystem, where
            the buyer’s journey doesn’t necessarily follow a linear path, and
            every interaction could potentially lead to a conversion. In today’s
            world, prospective customers aren’t bombarded with sales pitches the
            whole way. Instead they can access non-sales content and engage at
            their own pace, so that they’ve already made their decision by the
            time they pick up the phone.

            Companies that take a human-centered approach to their advertising
            are communicating that they care about more than simply duping their
            customers into spending money. Content marketing opens up countless
            creative opportunities for brands to shine a spotlight on their
            company values and show their customers some love. Being authentic
            and accountable is always in style.

            Content marketing supports and strengthens other digital marketing
