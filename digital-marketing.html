              <strong>Powerful and Compelling</strong>
              Digital Marketing
            </h2>
            <p>
              We live and work in a 24-hour, media-driven world. Consumers today
              are savvier than ever before, and they fully expect the businesses
              and services they use to keep up with their preferences. Digital
              marketing is no longer an extra feature or luxury service that
              companies can do without – it has already become an integrated
              part of “business as usual”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Digital marketing is an umbrella term that encompasses the various
              tools and methods businesses can use to find and connect with
              customers online. Compared to conventional advertising, digital
              methods are generally more precise, less annoying and more
              invested in the customer’s experience. By integrating digital
              tactics with conventional marketing practices, businesses can
              reach exponentially more customers, at all times, in a variety of
              ways. Only through the internet can your company seek out specific
              individuals while being available to anyone in the world.
            </p>

              <h2>Don't Be A Dinosaur</h2>
              <p>
                Businesses that continue to ignore digital marketing will only
                miss out on new customers and opportunities. If you aren’t
                actively trying to meet your customers where they are – in the
                online spaces where they spend time and make purchasing
                decisions – you’re already falling behind your competitors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many small businesses know they need a digital marketing
                strategy but feel too intimidated by the technology to know
                where to start. There’s a lot of advice out there, but how do
                you know which tools and tactics are best suited to your
                customers and your business goals? At Torx, we understand that
                strategy is the most important piece of digital marketing, and
                we’ll help you determine which tools and tactics will achieve
                the best results.

            If you aren’t connecting with customers online, you’re late to the
            party. Even worse, you may never know the full potential of your
            online marketplace. Your customers are online every day: Checking
            their email, engaging on social media and perusing their favorite
            websites. If they can’t find you online at their own convenience,
            they’ll find your competitors instead.

            Conventional advertising is much weaker than it used to be.
            Customers have become immune to the obnoxious old tactics, and they
            can smell a bad ad sooner than they can click the tiny “x” on an
            intrusive pop-up. In an age where tech-loving customers can block
            banner ads and fast-forward through commercials, the best
            advertising hardly looks anything like advertising. Businesses need
            sophisticated tactics to stay relevant and step up their game.

            More often than not, your customers are using the internet for
            research before making the decision to spend their money.
            Pay-Per-Click web advertising, social media marketing and content
            marketing can easily lead those prospective customers to the
            information they want. This means customers can keep moving
            themselves down the sales funnel – no cold calling required.

            Results from internet marketing are measurable, so it’s easier to
            identify what’s working and what needs to change. It can be
            impossible to truly know how many people heard a radio ad or saw a
            TV commercial, and good luck calculating those conversion rates. But
            if you’re interpreting social media metrics, website analytics or
            customer feedback, there are a multitude of ways to determine
            whether your digital marketing strategy is worth your investment.

            Your business is unique, and every brand has a distinct personality.
            Digital marketing provides endless creative opportunities to stand
            out from the competitors by expressing your company’s identity.
            Businesses that are active on social media find fun, informative or
            helpful ways to promote awareness of their brand and connect with
            potential customers beyond making the dreaded hard sell.
