              Search engine marketing is an ongoing, ever-changing cat-and-mouse
              game that involves getting your website and your business listed
              as high as possible in search engine results pages. Many factors
              come into play: keywords and phrases used on your website (or in
              your pay-per-click advertisements), what your competitors are
              doing, as well as the size of your marketing budget. Search engine
              marketing is typically comprised of these two different
              strategies: (1) search engine optimization and (2) pay-per-click
              advertising. More often than not, we recommend using a combination
              of both of these options to give your business as many
              opportunities as possible to be found by your customers when they
              perform searches on Google and other search engines.
            </p>
            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
              Most search engines, repeatedly over time, visit your website with
              their “spiders” or “crawlers”. These “spiders” and “crawlers” are
              automated computer programs that collect data from your site. That
              data is then used by the search engines to determine your
              “ranking” when someone searches for keywords associated with your
              business. Many variables are used by search engines in determining
              where your website appears on search engine results pages.
              Criteria such as relevance, keyword matches, website copy, and
              inbound links all play a part. It is usually very valuable for
              your business to be listed highly in search engine results, but it
              takes a lot of time and planning to get a prominent ranking. There
              are programmatic methods for improving search engine rankings, and
              there are ongoing link-building and keyword-related initiatives
              involved with SEO as well. We can design a search engine
              optimization campaign that takes advantage of all of these ways to
              drive more traffic to your website.
            </p>
            <h2>Pay-Per-Click Advertising</h2>
            <p>
              Your new website has just been launched and you’re excited to know
              that customers are going to be knocking down your door to purchase
              your products and services. But how are your customers going to
              find your website? The Web is a very big place, and it’s quite
              possible that you’ll have some competition. How can your business
              (and your website) stand out from the crowd? Don’t worry about
              searching for new customers – let your customers find you by
              taking advantage of pay-per-click advertising platforms such as
              Google Ads. Google Ads enables advertisers to select keywords that
              trigger ads to appear when Google users search for those keywords.
              Each advertiser sets their budget and selects a geographic region
              in which to advertise. Google Ads also includes a wide range of
              reporting tools to manage your campaigns. New Google Ads campaigns
              can be set up and activated in less than one day, as opposed to
              traditional SEO (search engine optimization) initiatives, which
              sometimes take several months to see any results. Additionally,
              because of the various reporting tools available, it is much
              easier to calculate risk and return on investment with paid
              advertising. Our pay-per-click services include keyword research,
              campaign setup with Google Ads, ad copy composition, ongoing
              campaign and keyword analysis, and monthly reports and statistics.
